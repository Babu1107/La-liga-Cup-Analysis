<h4>Objective : We want to use statistical techniques to come up with metrics with which can be used to gauge the winning team in the upcoming La Liga cup (Football tournament)</h4>
Domain: Sports<br>
<h4>Finding answers to the following questions : </h4>
1. Read the data set and replace dashes with 0 to make sure you can perform arithmetic operations on the data.<br>
2. Print all the teams which have started playing between 1930-1980.<br>
3. Print the list of teams which came Top 5 in terms of points.<br>
4. Write a function with the name “Goal_diff_count” which should return all the teams with their Goal Differences.<br>
5. Using the same function, find the team which has the maximum and minimum goal difference.<br>
6. Create a new column with the name “Winning Percent” and append it to the data set.<br>
7. Print the top 5 teams which have the highest Winning percentage.<br>
8. Group teams based on their “Best position” and print the sum of their points for all positions.<br>
